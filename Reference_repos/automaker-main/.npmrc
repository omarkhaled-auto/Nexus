# Cross-platform compatibility for Tailwind CSS v4 and lightningcss
# These packages use platform-specific optional dependencies that npm
# automatically resolves based on your OS (macOS, Linux, Windows, WSL)
#
# IMPORTANT: When switching platforms or getting platform mismatch errors:
# 1. Delete node_modules: rm -rf node_modules apps/*/node_modules
# 2. Run: npm install
#
# In CI/CD: Use "npm install" instead of "npm ci" to allow npm to resolve
# the correct platform-specific binaries at install time.

# Include bindings for all platforms in package-lock.json to support CI/CD
# This ensures Linux, macOS, and Windows bindings are all present
# NOTE: Only enable when regenerating package-lock.json, then comment out to keep installs fast
# supportedArchitectures.os=linux,darwin,win32
# supportedArchitectures.cpu=x64,arm64
