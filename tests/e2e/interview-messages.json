    "I want to build a simple todo app inspired by Monday.com's clean design. This will be a React + Vite web application that runs entirely in the browser.",

    "The app needs these features:\n1. Display a list of tasks as cards\n2. Each task has a title, optional description, and completion status\n3. Add new tasks via an input form at the top\n4. Edit task titles inline by clicking on them\n5. Delete tasks with a trash icon (show confirmation)\n6. Toggle task completion with a checkbox\n7. Filter tasks: Show All, Active only, or Completed only\n8. Store all tasks in localStorage so they persist on refresh",

    "For the UI design:\n- Use Monday.com's purple (#6161FF) as the accent color\n- Clean white background with subtle gray borders\n- Cards have rounded corners and subtle shadows\n- Smooth hover animations on interactive elements\n- Responsive: stack vertically on mobile, horizontal filters on desktop",

    "Technical stack:\n- React 18 with TypeScript\n- Vite as the build tool\n- Tailwind CSS for styling\n- No external state management (React useState is fine)\n- No backend - pure client-side localStorage\n- Structure: components/, hooks/, types/ folders"
